# MicroTasker ‚Äì Web App Specification

## **Project Summary**
MicroTasker is a **web-first productivity app** designed to help users capture micro-tasks quickly, refine them later, and execute them efficiently without feeling overwhelmed. The app focuses on replacing idle time (scrolling social media, waiting, etc.) with **tiny, meaningful tasks** that compound into big achievements over time. It is not just a task manager; it‚Äôs a **micro-tasking system** for consistent progress.
